/*
 * NXP PCF50635 power management unit, at I2C address 0xe6 (7-bit 0x73).
 *
 * The first chip Apple's retailOS talks to. 0x08325a20 starts the transfer and
 * then blocks on RTXC event 61 with nothing but a retry loop behind it, so an
 * iPod classic with nothing on I2C0 boots as far as its idle task and stays
 * there for ever -- which is exactly where this machine stopped before this
 * file existed.
 *
 * The bus protocol is a register-pointer device: a write starts with the
 * register number and the pointer advances after every byte; a read carries on
 * from wherever the pointer was left. That the pointer survives the end of a
 * transaction is not a guess -- Rockbox's i2c_rd() sends the register number in
 * one transaction and reads in a second one (i2c-s5l8702.c, i2c_wr_internal
 * with len 0 followed by i2c_rd_internal), and Apple's driver does the same.
 *
 * Register numbers are from Rockbox's firmware/export/pcf5063x.h, with the
 * three undocumented ones (INT6 0x85, INT6M 0x86, GPIOSTAT 0x87) from
 * firmware/target/arm/s5l8702/ipod6g/pmu-target.h.
 *
 * WHAT IS MODELLED
 *
 *   - The register file, which is what most of this chip is to a driver:
 *     regulator voltages, enables, interrupt masks and standby control get
 *     written and, when read back, have to read back.
 *   - The A/D converter. ADCC1 bit 0 starts a conversion; ADCS1/ADCS2/ADCS3
 *     return a 10-bit result with ADCRDY set. See the note on the value below.
 *   - The interrupt status registers INT1..INT5 and INT6, which are
 *     read-to-clear on the real chip and therefore must not be a plain
 *     register file: a driver that reads them expects the bits to go away.
 *
 * WHAT IS NOT
 *
 *   - The RTC. It reads back whatever was written, which is wrong, and is
 *     flagged here because an absent RTC has a visible side effect:
 *     Rockbox decides an alarm has gone off on every boot.
 *   - Charging, the ON/OFF controller and the regulators. Writing them changes
 *     nothing, because there is no voltage in here for a voltage to mean.
 *   - The chip's interrupt output. Nothing is wired to it yet.
 *
 * ASSUMED, and marked as such because nothing derives them:
 *
 *   - VERSION (0x00) and VARIANT (0x01). No dump of a real PCF50635 exists in
 *     any of our sources, and neither Rockbox nor iPodLinux reads them. They
 *     answer zero. If the firmware turns out to compare them against something
 *     the disassembly will say what, and then they get a real value.
 *   - The battery reading, 844 out of 1023. Through Rockbox's own conversion
 *     (pmu-6g.c: raw * 2000 / 1023 + 2250) that is 3900 mV, an ordinary
 *     charged-but-not-full lithium cell. Nothing in our sources says what a
 *     real one reads; the number is chosen to be unremarkable.

 * empty" (about one navtest run in six).
 *
 * On real hardware the firmware serialises PMU access so the write never
 * interleaves; our timing does not reproduce that serialisation, so the model
 * compensates: a register write restores the pointer at STOP (above), which
 * un-clobbers whatever pointer a pending read had set. Combined with the forced
 * HOLD_OFF / healthy-status reads, the three status reads are now stable

     * 0x0803f390 calls that chain at 0x0803f3e0 -- through the tail branch
     * 0x08030d48, which is a bare "b 0x080634a4" -- and returns immediately
     * when the answer is non-zero ("cmp r0,#0" / "popne {r4,r5,r6,pc}" at
     * 0x0803f3e4). Same polarity, arrived at from the other end.
     *
     * (0x0803f3e0 is the 21st instruction of that function, not the second:
     * the entry first remaps the keycode through four compares. Nothing
     * depends on where it sits, but an earlier version of this comment said
     * "one instruction after the entry" and that was simply wrong.)
     *
     * MEASURED, before and after. With the register at 0 the wheel worked and
     * the buttons did not: holding ENTER down for three seconds and reading
     * the firmware's own state block showed 0x089116d8+0x1C = 1 (the packet
     * arrived) and +0x14 = 1 (the edge detector ran and called the dispatcher)
     * -- and the screen never changed, because the dispatcher dropped the key
     * one instruction later. The turn of the wheel does not pass through
     * 0x0803f390 at all, which is exactly why it was not affected and why the
     * failure looked like a wheel bug rather than a hold switch.
     *
     * CONVENIENCE VALUE, and marked as one: a machine with no hold switch to
     * flip has to boot with it off or it cannot be used. PMUHOLD=on forces the
     * switch engaged instead, which drops every button. The other two bits
     * stay zero -- Rockbox marks both "TBC" and nothing we have reads them.
