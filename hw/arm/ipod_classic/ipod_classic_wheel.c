/*
 * S5L8702 click wheel, 0x3C200000, IRQ 23.
 *
 * The register map, the two packet formats, the constraints the firmware's own
 * scroll decoder puts on any model, and the measurement that says the
 * interrupt path is already armed all live in the header. Read that first;
 * this file is the mechanism.
 *
 * Two decisions here are worth stating in one place because they are the ones
 * that make the difference between "the model answers" and "the guest moves":
 *
 *  - WHEELMASK reads back what was written. The firmware saves it, zeroes it
 *    around a polled transaction, and restores it; while this block read as
 *    zero the restore wrote zero and the interrupt stayed masked for ever.
 *
 *  - Packets are PACED by a timer, one per tick, instead of being queued in a
 *    burst. The firmware needs to see the arming packet of a gesture as its
 *    own interrupt: its scroll decoder compares the new position word against
 *    the previous one and does nothing at all unless both have the
 *    finger-down bit. Queue two packets back to back and the ISR can consume
 *    both before the wheel task runs once, in which case the task sees only
 *    the second, decides it is a first touch, and throws the movement away.
 *
 * WHEELTRACE=2 additionally logs every key event, queued button edge and
 * packet with its virtual time.
 *
 * WHEELTRACE=1 announces the first command, the first packet and the first
 * time the line is raised, and prints totals at exit -- announcing the first
 * of each rather than every one, because stderr is where the firmware's own
 * semihosting output goes and it has to stay readable.
