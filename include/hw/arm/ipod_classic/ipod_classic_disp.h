/*
 * S5L8702 display pipe, 0x38900000.
 *
 * NO SOURCE WE HAVE NAMES THIS BLOCK. Rockbox's s5l87xx.h does not list it,
 * freemyipod's model has nothing there, and Rockbox never touches it -- Rockbox
 * pushes its frame through DMAC0 into LCD_WDATA instead (lcd-s5l8702.c:172).
 * Everything below comes from disassembling Apple's own osos, and from a
 * measured boot; where the two disagree the measurement wins and it is said so.
 *
 * WHY IT MATTERS. 0x08127f14, the retailOS's "draw the whole screen", ends
 * with two stores to the LCD frame engine (LCD +0x74 geometry, LCD +0x70 = 1
 * "go") and no pixel ever goes through the LCD data port. Nothing in the LCD's
 * own 256-byte window says where that frame comes from. This block does: it has
 * the panel geometry, three layer descriptors, five-plus source-address slots,
 * three 256-entry gamma tables and four colour-matrix coefficient tables. It is
 * the composition engine the LCD frame engine presents.
 *
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------- registers
 *
 * Every entry below is either (V) verified from a store or load in the osos
 * whose base register was loaded with the literal 0x38900000 (twenty-seven
 * sites) -- or (M) additionally
 * confirmed by the value seen in a real boot, or (U) undetermined.
 *
 *  +0x000  (M) written 1 by the init path. Meaning UNDETERMINED.
 *  +0x004  (M) written 1 by 0x0812729c. Meaning UNDETERMINED.
 *  +0x008  (V,M) THE CONTROL REGISTER. Six different functions do
 *          read-modify-write on it, one bit field each, which is why leaving
 *          this block unimplemented was actively harmful: reads returned 0, so
 *          every RMW threw away every bit set before it.
 *            bit 0      0x080a508c arg r3 == 1
 *            bit 1      0x080a511c arg != 0
 *            bits 2..7  0x081271c8, six selectors (6,5,4,3,2,7 for sel 0..5)
 *            bit 8      0x080822e8 arg == 0
 *            bit 15     0x0808dfe4 arg == 1
 *            bits 17:16 0x080a508c byte arg at sp+10 (1 or 2)
 *            bit 20     0x080a508c byte arg at sp+9 == 1
 *            bits 25:24 0x080a508c byte arg at sp+8 (1 or 2)
 *            bit 28     0x080a508c arg r1 == 1
 *            bit 29     0x080a508c arg r0 != 0
 *            bit 30     0x080be518 arg != 0
 *          MEASURED, diskless boot: the values that reach it are 0x01110001,
 *          0x00008000, 0x00000100 and 0x40000000 -- each one a single field
 *          written onto a zero readback. 0x01110001 is exactly what
 *          0x080a508c(0, 0, {1,1,1}, 1) computes, which is the call the init
 *          path makes, so the decode above is confirmed end to end.
 *  +0x00c  (M) 0x000f0f0f from a literal at 0x08127460. UNDETERMINED.
 *  +0x020  (M) written 1 next to +0x004. UNDETERMINED.
 *  +0x024  (M) 0x00ffffff. UNDETERMINED.
 *  +0x030  (V) destination rectangle origin, (y | x << 16)
 *  +0x034  (V) destination rectangle limit, ((y+h) | (x+w) << 16)
 *          Both from 0x08127964, the blit entry point.
 *  +0x038  (V) SOURCE ADDRESS, plane 0   \
 *  +0x03c  (V) SOURCE ADDRESS, plane 1    |  written together by 0x081276dc
 *  +0x040  (V) SOURCE ADDRESS, plane 2    |  case 5, the planar-YUV path, for
 *  +0x044  (V) SOURCE ADDRESS, plane 3   /   pixel formats 8, 9 and 10.
 *  +0x04c  (V) (dstW | dstH << 16) from 0x08127d8c
 *  +0x050  (V) (x | y << 16) centring offset, 0x08127e30
 *  +0x054  (V) (w | h << 16) clipped size, 0x08127e20
 *  +0x060  (V) SOURCE ADDRESS, slot 0  \
 *  +0x078  (V) SOURCE ADDRESS, slot 1   |  0x081276dc cases 0..4. Stride 0x18.
 *  +0x090  (V) SOURCE ADDRESS, slot 2   |  Which slot is used is chosen by the
 *  +0x0a8  (V) SOURCE ADDRESS, slot 3   |  caller, not by this block.
 *  +0x0c0  (V) SOURCE ADDRESS, slot 4  /
 *  +0x0d4  (M) (a | b << 8) from 0x0812793c. UNDETERMINED.
 *  +0x0d8  (V,M) LAYER 0 config, +0x0dc LAYER 0 (second word)
 *  +0x0e0  (V,M) LAYER 1 config, +0x0e4 LAYER 1
 *  +0x0e8  (V,M) LAYER 2 config, +0x0ec LAYER 2
 *          The config word is built by 0x080b0140 as
 *          (fmt << 28) | (a << 16) | (b << 12) | c, and the second word is set
 *          by 0x080a9614 to a plain value. MEASURED on a diskless boot: the
 *          init path calls 0x080b0140(i, 0, 0, 1, 0) and 0x080a9614(i, 0) for
 *          i in 0..2, so all three configs are 0x00001000 and all three second
 *          words 0 -- which is what that trace shows, decode confirmed. A boot
 *          WITH a disk goes further and rewrites +0x0e0 and +0x0e8 as the user
 *          interface runs (MEASURED: 17 and 21 writes in 45 s, +0x0e8 ending on
 *          0x50004000); +0x0d8 is never written again. Nothing here gates the
 *          picture in this model -- see the note on the control register in
 *          ipod_classic_disp_compose().
 *  +0x0f0..+0x17c (V) nine 4-word entries, copied by 0x081276a0
 *  +0x180..+0x1c4 (V) nine 2-word entries, copied by 0x08127664
 *  +0x1ec..+0x1fc (V,M) five words copied straight out of a struct by
 *          0x080bf110. MEASURED 0, 0, 0x10, 0, 0. UNDETERMINED.
 *  +0x200  (V,M) bit 0 set/cleared by 0x08096eb8, and OR'd with 0x00010080 by
 *          0x081273f8. Both are read-modify-write and it is genuinely read
 *          back, so a zero readback here really did lose state.
 *  +0x204  (V,M) 2, at 0x0812740c.   +0x208 (V,M) 0, at 0x08127428.
 *  +0x20c  (V,M) 2, at 0x08127410.
 *  +0x210  (V,M) 0x00010110, a literal at 0x08127464.
 *  +0x214  (V,M) 0x013f00ef -- (319 << 16) | 239, THE PANEL GEOMETRY, to the
 *          pixel, a literal at 0x08127468. Nothing else in this block is as
 *          unambiguous.
 *          These six live in the init function 0x08127268, which reaches them
 *          through r6 rather than a fresh literal, which is why scanning for
 *          pc-relative loads of 0x38900000 did not find them. The trace found
 *          them: DISPTRACE prints the guest PC with every access.
 *  +0x31c..+0x360 (V) nine 2-word entries, copied by 0x081275ec
 *  +0x364..+0x3a8 (V) nine 2-word entries, copied by 0x08127628
 *  +0x3ac  (V,M) 0x080bcef8 builds it as
 *          (w << 20) | (h << 8) | (c << 2) | (d << 1) | e, and 0x08127f54 calls
 *          it with (64, 64, 0, 0, 0) -> 0x04004000, which is exactly what the
 *          boot writes. Bit 0 is read back by the blit at five places and
 *          swaps width for height everywhere it is tested, so bit 0 is
 *          "rotated 90 degrees". INFERRED from that use, not from a datasheet.
 *  +0x400..+0x7fc (M) 256-entry gamma/palette table, channel 0
 *  +0x800..+0xbfc (M) channel 1
 *  +0xc00..+0xffc (M) channel 2
 *          0x0806fe9c is the writer and 0x08127268 builds the argument as
 *          tbl[i] = i * 4 for i in 0..255, so what the boot loads is the
 *          identity ramp, left-shifted by two. MEASURED: all 768 words, value
 *          == index * 4, in all three tables.
 *
 * Nothing above +0xfff was touched in a whole diskless boot, so the window is
 * 4 KB and the rest of the 1 MB block still falls to the machine's io floor,
 * where -d unimp will report it if that ever stops being true.
 *
 * WHAT THIS MODEL DOES: store every register honestly, and compose the layers
 * into the panel when the panel is about to be shown. See the layer-descriptor
 * note below, and ipod_classic_disp.c for the composition itself.
 *
 * WHAT IT DOES NOT DO: the gamma tables, the four colour-matrix coefficient
 * tables, the scaler (+0x04c/+0x50/+0x54), the destination rectangle
 * (+0x030/+0x034) and the rotate bit in +0x3ac are all stored and read back but
 * none of them affects the picture. Every one of them is the identity in every
 * boot measured so far -- the gamma tables are literally tbl[i] = i * 4 -- so
 * honouring them would change nothing today and could only be tested against a
 * guest that stops using the identity.
 *
 * A boot with no disk never writes a source address into any slot at all
 * (MEASURED: zero writes to +0x038..+0x0c0 in a 40-second diskless boot,
 * because the user interface dies for want of fonts long before it composes
 * anything), so it draws nothing and the panel stays black. That is the guest's
 * behaviour, not the model's. Set DISPTRACE=1 to watch the registers.

/*
 * THE FIVE LAYER DESCRIPTORS, and this is what puts pixels on the panel.
 *
 * 0x0812705c..0x0812716c is one five-way switch on the layer index (jump table
 * at 0x08127068, arms at 0x08127080, 0x081270b0, 0x081270e0, 0x08127110 and
 * 0x08127140); every arm writes the same FIVE registers at base 0x058 + k*0x18:
 *
 *   +0x00  source stride in bytes            (r2 = bpp * srcW / 2 ... see below)
 *   +0x04  (align << 24) | (fmt << 8) | ...  bit 16 set when NOT 32 bpp
 *   +0x0c  (W << 16) | H          destination size
 *   +0x10  W * bytes-per-pixel / 4          (a cross-check, not used here)
 *   +0x14  (X << 16) | Y          destination position
 *
 * The sixth word of the descriptor, and the one that matters most --
 *
 *   +0x08  SOURCE ADDRESS, already advanced to the first visible pixel
 *
 * -- is NOT written by this switch. It comes from a separate five-way switch in
 * 0x081276dc, which is why a boot can program a descriptor's geometry without
 * ever giving it something to read from.
 *
 * VERIFIED against a real boot with a disk. Layer 0:
 *   +0x058 = 0x00000500 (1280 = 320 * 4), +0x05c = 0x00000700 (fmt 7, and bit
 *   16 clear so 32 bpp), +0x060 = 0x09767a24, +0x064 = 0x014000f0 (320 x 240),
 *   +0x06c = 0. Layer 1:
 *   +0x070 = 0x00000280 (640 = 320 * 2), +0x074 = 0x02010300 (fmt 3, bit 16
 *   set so 16 bpp), +0x078 = 0x0be2326c, +0x07c = 0x006c00f0 (108 x 240),
 *   +0x084 = 0x00d40000 (x = 212, and 212 + 108 = 320 exactly).
 *
 * The bytes-per-pixel table comes from the switch at 0x08126f90, which maps the
 * format field to a multiplier r1 in {1, 2, 4, 8} and then computes the stride
 * as r1 * srcW / 2 -- so r1 is twice the bytes per pixel:
 *   fmt 0 -> 4 bpp, fmt 1 -> 8 bpp, fmt 2..5 -> 16 bpp, fmt 6..7 -> 32 bpp.
 * Both measured layers agree with it to the byte.
 *
 * W and H are SIGNED. MEASURED: while the right-hand pane slides off screen the
 * firmware writes +0x07c = 0xffc900f0, i.e. width -55. Anything with a
 * non-positive width or height, or an origin off the panel, is not drawn.

 * THE PER-LAYER ENABLE BITS, in CONTROL (+0x008). Bit 6 turns layer 0 on,
 * bit 5 layer 1, bit 4 layer 2 -- so layer k is bit (6 - k).
 *
 * This is the gate that was missing, and without it the model kept drawing
 * layers the guest had switched off but left fully programmed, which covered
 * the whole user interface with a stale surface. Two independent lines of
 * evidence, both from a boot with a disk:
 *
 * 1. THE SETTER, disassembled. 0x081271c8 takes an index in r1 and a boolean
 *    in r2, jumps through the table at 0x081271d8, and does
 *    "bic r0, r0, #BIT / orrne r0, r0, #BIT" on the word it read from +0x008
 *    before storing it back at 0x08127250. The arms are, in index order:
 *      0 -> 0x40   1 -> 0x20   2 -> 0x10   3 -> 0x08   4 -> 0x04   5 -> 0x80
 *    Indices 0..2 are the three layers; 3..5 are something else and only
 *    index 5 (bit 7) is ever seen, twice, in a whole run.
 *
 * 2. THE ORDER OF WRITES, traced with DISPTRACE=1. Every single time, the
 *    guest programs a descriptor, writes its SOURCE ADDRESS, and only then
 *    sets the matching bit:
 *      +0x060 = 0x089d42d4 (layer 0) ... +0x008: 0x41118101 -> 0x41118141
 *      +0x078 = 0x0be2326c (layer 1) ... +0x008: 0x41118141 -> 0x41118161
 *      +0x090 = 0x0bfb4ff8 (layer 2) ... +0x008: 0x41118161 -> 0x41118171
 *    and when a transition ends it clears them again, 0x41118151 then
 *    0x41118141, WITHOUT clearing the source address or the size. A settled
 *    screen sits at 0x41118141: layer 0 alone.
 *
 * Not to be confused with bits 16, 20 and 24, which also look one-per-layer.
 * An earlier version of the compositor weighed those, found them set once
 * during init and never touched again, and rejected them as a gate -- which
 * was correct about 16/20/24, and became the wrong conclusion only because it
 * stopped there and declared that nothing gated a layer at all.
 *
 * Layers 3 and 4 have no known enable bit. No boot has ever written their
 * descriptors, so the question has never come up; see the compositor.
