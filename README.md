# Two clickwheel iPods in QEMU, booting Apple's real firmware

This fork of [QEMU-iOS](https://github.com/devos50/qemu-ios) adds **two machines**
that emulate clickwheel iPods and **boot real software dumped from the physical
devices**, with no boot ROM and without patching a single firmware instruction.

| Machine | SoC | What it boots |
|---|---|---|
| **`iPod-Classic`** | Samsung S5L8702 | **Apple's retailOS**: RTXC kernel, disk, fonts, full clickwheel navigation, and **the music player — Now Playing screen and audio out of the guest's own I2S** |
| **`iPod-Video`** | PortalPlayer PP5022C | **Rockbox** up to its menu, navigable, and **Apple's retailOS**: language screen → main menu → submenus → back |

Neither machine emulates Apple's boot ROM. The *hardware* the firmware touches is
modelled, and what that ROM left in memory is reproduced by hand. Full detail in
[`wiki/`](wiki/).

> **You need your own iPod.** This repository ships **no firmware**. Every dumped
> artefact lives in `assets/`, which is kept out of git on purpose: it is not ours to
> redistribute. Without your own dump there is nothing to boot. Both dump chains are
> documented below.

*Apple's own Now Playing screen, in the emulator: album art, track, artist, album,
track N of M and the progress bar. Audio is carried by the firmware's own render pump,
DMA and I2S.*

---

## The music player

The player was the last and longest wall. It used to come up half-drawn and silent, and
drop back to the song list after 18 seconds.

![Before and after](docs/screenshots/before-after.png)

Four separate bugs stood between those two screenshots. The third one is the one worth
seeing.

### The compositor was covering the player

**The player screen was being drawn the whole time.** Dumping the display pipe's
surfaces with the player open, layer 0 holds the entire player UI — title bar, artist,
album, track N of M, progress bar — and layer 1 holds the album art, opaque and full
screen. The compositor drew back-to-front starting at layer 0, so the art erased the
player and left exactly the blank right-hand side that made the screen look half-drawn.

![What the compositor drew vs what it should draw](docs/screenshots/compositor-bug.png)

Same frame, same data on both sides. The only difference is the order the two layers
are composited in.

The other half of the same bug: the model was **discarding the layer's alpha channel**.
It really has one — the alpha byte takes 246 distinct values across the surface and the
layer is 82% transparent.

![The two layers](docs/screenshots/layers.png)

Compositing front-to-back with source-over fixes it, and it still explains the
language-screen wipe that the original back-to-front Z order had been inferred from:
that inference assumed opaque layers, which is where it went wrong.

### The other three

1. **The render pump gave up after exactly 8 calls, every run.** The function that hands
   out audio buffers guards on a halfword in internal RAM, and watching that address
   across a whole three-minute run — boot included — showed that **no CPU access ever
   writes it**. The audio engine keeps state in IRAM that the firmware reads back, and
   the model was a register file that never wrote memory. What made it implementable
   rather than guesswork: the geometry is not a hidden hardware constant — the engine
   publishes it and the firmware reads it back to derive the buffer address and size.
   Render pump went from 8 activations to 1343, at ~20/s, which is exactly the slot
   cadence at 44.1 kHz.

2. **The copy direction was backwards.** The pump acquires a codec buffer and copies
   *into* it from the IRAM slot. Filling the codec buffers meant writing to the far end
   of that memcpy, where the firmware overwrote it immediately.

3. **"Low Battery — Connect to Power".** The battery ADC was being read correctly the
   whole time; what was missing was telling the firmware it was plugged in.

![Audio waveform](docs/screenshots/audio-waveform.png)

Audio captured off the emulator's I2S with the host shortcut disabled, so the only
possible path is the guest's own render pump, DMA and I2S. 77-80% non-silent samples
once playback is going.

**Still broken:** elapsed time stays at 0:00, pause stops the audio but will not resume,
and switching tracks gives a burst and then silence. The MP3 decode itself is done
host-side, the way an emulator handles an undocumented on-chip codec; everything else —
track selection, transport, render pump, DMA, I2S — runs on the firmware.

Full write-up: [`wiki/20-classic6g-reproductor.md`](wiki/20-classic6g-reproductor.md)
(how it was fixed) and [`wiki/19-classic6g-dsp-hle.md`](wiki/19-classic6g-dsp-hle.md)
(the investigation, including the ~16 hypotheses that had to be retracted).

## Navigation

| | | |
|---|---|---|
| ![Language](docs/screenshots/language.png) | ![Main menu](docs/screenshots/main-menu.png) | ![Music menu](docs/screenshots/music-menu.png) |
| Language screen | Main menu | Music menu |

![Song list](docs/screenshots/song-list.png)

The library reads from a real `iTunesDB` on a FAT32 volume built by the tools in
`tools/ipod_classic/`.

## Building

Built under WSL against a tree living on Windows. **The binary is a Linux ELF: it only
runs under WSL.** Full detail and three environment traps (CRLF, git symlinks,
`--disable-werror`) in [`wiki/05-build-notes.md`](wiki/05-build-notes.md).

```bash
# Configure (once)
mkdir -p build && cd build
../configure --enable-sdl --disable-cocoa --target-list=arm-softmmu \
             --disable-capstone --disable-slirp \
             --extra-cflags=-I/usr/include/openssl --extra-ldflags=-lcrypto \
             --disable-werror --enable-pie

# Build
ninja qemu-system-arm
```

Dependencies on Ubuntu 24.04:

```bash
sudo apt install -y libsdl2-dev libssl-dev libglib2.0-dev libpixman-1-dev \
                    ninja-build python3-venv dosfstools mtools
```

A cold build takes about **16 minutes**. A no-op `ninja` takes ~20 s warm, but can take
**6 minutes** the first time after touching files from Windows — that is the 9p cache
on `/mnt/c`, not a broken build.

## Running the iPod Classic 6G

You need the **decrypted** `osos` (see [the chain](#dumping-from-a-physical-ipod-classic-6g))
and a disk image built from the `.ipsw` firmware partition.

```bash
# The disk. The FAT32 volume is deliberately EMPTY: the fonts live in the
# FIRMWARE partition, not here.
truncate -s 64M ~/6g/fat32.img && mkfs.vfat -F 32 -n IPOD ~/6g/fat32.img
python3 tools/ipod_classic/mkdisk6g4k.py ~/6g/E.img \
        assets/firmware/24.9.1.2/extracted/Firmware-24.9.1.2 ~/6g/fat32.img

# Boot
cd build && ./qemu-system-arm -M iPod-Classic \
    -kernel ../assets/firmware/24.9.1.2/osos_decrypted.bin -serial null \
    -drive if=ide,format=raw,file=$HOME/6g/E.img -snapshot
```

- **Without `-drive` there is no picture**, and that is the guest's doing, not the
  model's: the UI dies looking for fonts, which live in the firmware's `rsrc`
  partition. It enters a crash-and-reboot cycle.
- `-serial null` keeps the console clean. **The firmware talks on stderr**
  (semihosting) — never discard it.

### Running the music player

Audio playback does **not** work in QEMU. The guest's MeCCA decoder never
produces its first block (see `todo.md`), and the host-side HLE that used to
substitute for it has been removed. The remaining audio/display models are tuned
by the flags in [`hw/arm/ipod_classic/README.md`](hw/arm/ipod_classic/README.md):

```sh
IRAMSPILL=0x10000 SHA1_ZERO=1 SM1_IRQ=1 \
DISP_ALPHA=1 PMUCHARGER=adapter \
./qemu-system-arm -M iPod-Classic ... -display sdl
```

`AUDIOWAV=/path.wav` captures everything the I2S clocks out (silence until the
guest's own decoder runs). There is no live audio backend — the I2S model only
writes WAV. To hear it while it runs, pipe the file to a player; note that
`ffplay` **hangs silently** unless you set `SDL_AUDIODRIVER=pulse`.

### Keys

| Key | Button |
|---|---|
| `q` / `e` | wheel anticlockwise / clockwise |
| `Enter` | SELECT (centre button) |
| `w` | MENU |
| `a` / `d` | previous / next |
| `s` | PLAY / PAUSE |

Same as the 5G machine, so one habit covers both. Note the retailOS clickwheel **drops
roughly 5 of every 7 SELECT presses** — if it does not register, press again.

### Properties and trace variables

| Property | Default | What it does |
|---|---|---|
| `bootrom` | *(none)* | Path to an S5L8702 boot ROM binary. If given, it keeps address 0 instead of the IRAM0 alias — **we have none**, see [`wiki/10`](wiki/10-classic6g-emcore.md) |
| `semihosting` | `on` | Answers ARM semihosting. **Leave it on**: it is how the retailOS prints its panics |

There is no `entry` property: the decrypted `osos` is loaded raw at `0x08000000`, which
is its `addr` in the firmware directory.

| Variable | What it traces |
|---|---|
| `DISPTRACE=1` | the compositor at `0x38900000`, with guest PC and totals |
| `LCDTRACE=1` | the panel: commands, pixels and frame-engine starts |
| `ATATRACE=1` | the whole ATA conversation, register by register |
| `WHEELTRACE=1` | packets, commands and IRQ 23 edges |
| `SM1TRACE=1`, `PMUTRACE=1`, `I2SCOUNT=1`, `DMATRACE=1` | the audio path, the PMU, the I2S and the DMA controllers |

## Running the iPod Video 5G

Both firmwares come from the **same image** (`osos_full.bin`): the iPod is dual-boot and
`ipodpatcher` left Rockbox's bootloader behind Apple's firmware. Only the entry point
changes, which is the `entry` property.

```bash
# Rockbox
./build/qemu-system-arm -M "iPod-Video,entry=0x735a00" ...
```

See [`wiki/09-historia-5g.md`](wiki/09-historia-5g.md) for the full invocation.

## Dumping from a physical iPod Classic 6G

The project's founding blocker was that the Classic's `osos` is encrypted with the GID
key fused into the silicon. **You do not need to extract the key: you just need the
device itself to decrypt it.** Verified chain, full detail in
[`wiki/10-classic6g-emcore.md`](wiki/10-classic6g-emcore.md).

**1. Pull `Firmware-XX` out of the `.ipsw`** (it is a zip) and extract its four images
from the `]ih[` container:

```bash
python3 fwtool.py list    assets/firmware/24.9.1.2/extracted/Firmware-24.9.1.2
python3 fwtool.py extract assets/firmware/24.9.1.2/extracted/Firmware-24.9.1.2 assets/firmware/24.9.1.2/images
```

(`fwtool.py` is external firmware tooling, not in this tree.)

The `osos` that comes out is **encrypted**. The `rsrc` partition is not: it is a 78 MB
FAT16 volume with `Resources/Fonts` inside.

**2. Install emCORE** on the iPod (r859 or similar, freemyipod's bootloader).

**3. Decrypt the `osos` using the SoC's own AES engine**, over USB:

```bash
python3 tools/ipod_classic/emcore_s5l8702.py info
python3 tools/ipod_classic/emcore_s5l8702.py decrypt \
        assets/firmware/24.9.1.2/images/1_osos.payload assets/firmware/24.9.1.2/osos_decrypted.bin
```

Takes **1.2 s**. Neither official emCORE client works as-is (HEAD speaks a
post-r891 protocol; r859's calls pyusb with a parameter that disappeared in 1.0.0b1),
and there is one trap you must know to chunk it: `hwkeyaes()` **zeroes the IV at the
start of every call**, so the first block of each chunk comes out wrong — in CBC that
is repaired with an XOR against the previous chunk's last ciphertext block.

How you know it worked: **42,014 ASCII strings versus 0**, coherent ARM vectors,
`"Copyright 2001-2008 Apple Inc."`, `RTXC v3.2b`, and the literal UI strings (*Cover
Flow*, *Now Playing*).

**A negative result, verified:** the boot ROM **cannot** be read from the running
device. See `wiki/10` §4 — and §5, on how to avoid bricking one.

## Dumping from a physical iPod Video 5G

Requires a 5G with Rockbox installed: dual boot is what puts both firmwares in one
image. Full chain in [`wiki/09-historia-5g.md`](wiki/09-historia-5g.md); the short
version is `tools/ipod_video/dump-firmware.ps1` (Windows, admin) followed by
`fwtool.py` (external firmware tooling, not in this tree) and `tools/ipod_video/mkdisk.sh`.

## What is modelled

**iPod Classic 6G** — `hw/arm/ipod_classic/`, 16 files plus headers: ARM926EJ-S with
SDRAM and IRAM0/1 (and the IRAM0 alias at address 0, where the ARM926 takes its
exceptions), VIC0/VIC1, the clock block, timers, GPIO, I2C, the PCF50635 PMU, the
CS42L55 codec, ATA, the display pipe and LCD, the clickwheel, two PL080 DMA
controllers, I2S, the SHA-1 accelerator and the SM1 audio engine.

**iPod Video 5G** — `hw/arm/ipod_video/`, 8 files plus headers: PP5022C, the interrupt
controller, DMA, IDE, I2C, the PCF50605 PMU and the BCM video chip's protocol.

Detail, including what is *not* modelled, in
[`wiki/02-s5l8702-hardware.md`](wiki/02-s5l8702-hardware.md) and
[`wiki/07-pp502x-hardware.md`](wiki/07-pp502x-hardware.md).

## Known limits

Listed because the value of this documentation is that it can be trusted.

**iPod Classic 6G**

- **The player's elapsed time stays at 0:00.** Making the SM1 position register follow
  the I2S does not move it, so that counter comes from the player's own bookkeeping.
- **Pause does not resume, and switching tracks gives a burst then silence.** The PCM
  cursor never resets, so after a track change it reads out of position.
- **The MP3 decode is host-side.** Everything else runs on the firmware.
- **Every audio and display fix is behind an environment flag**, because each has
  measured trade-offs. The default build is byte-for-byte as it was.
- **No USB, no NAND, no CE-ATA, no RTC.**

**iPod Video 5G**

- **The wheel does not move the highlight on the retailOS language screen.** Measured
  (0 pixels), **not diagnosed**. It works in the main menu.
- **No audio** (neither I²S nor the WM8758 codec) and **no USB**.
- **The VideoCore does not execute**: its protocol is modelled, not its processor.
- **DRAM size is an open question**: 64 MB because that is what Rockbox reads from the
  silicon, though the firmware itself and iPodLinux's table say 32. Both work.

**Both**

- **Several constants are our choices or inferences**, not confirmed data. They are
  marked `ASSUMED` / `INFERRED` / `UNDETERMINED` in the code and collected in
  [`wiki/09`](wiki/09-historia-5g.md) and [`wiki/12`](wiki/12-historia-6g.md).
- `tools/ipod_video/navtest.sh` and `appletest.sh` **are not assertions, they are
  evidence generators**: they close the QEMU invocation with `|| true` and check
  nothing. **You have to look at the numbers.** `tools/ipod_classic/navtest.sh` *does*
  decide, and fails if the noise floor stops being 0.

## This repository is a fork

Forked from [devos50/qemu-ios](https://github.com/devos50/qemu-ios) (QEMU 8.2.0), branch
`ipod_touch_2g`, which emulates the **iPod Touch 1G and 2G**. That work is here intact
and its machines are listed in `-M help`:

- [Running the iPod Touch 1G](https://devos50.github.io/blog/2022/ipod-touch-qemu-pt2/)
  and the [technical write-up](https://devos50.github.io/blog/2022/ipod-touch-qemu/).
- [Running the iPod Touch 2G](https://github.com/devos50/qemu-ios/blob/ipod_touch_2g/RUNNING.md).

QEMU's own documentation is in [`docs/`](docs/); this README replaces the original
fork's.

This work depends on: **Rockbox** (open-source register-level drivers for both devices —
`firmware/target/arm/s5l8702/` and `firmware/export/s5l87xx.h` for the Classic,
`firmware/target/arm/ipod/` and `pp5020.h` for the 5G), **iPodLinux**
(`ipodloader2/ipodhw.c`, source of the SysInfo block), **ipodpatcher** (the dual-boot
model) and **[freemyipod.org](https://freemyipod.org/wiki/Classic_6G)** (emCORE, and a
QEMU model of the S5L8702 in `freemyipod/qemu@s5l8702-dev`).
